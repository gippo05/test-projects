Learning node and express


1st item is my first Login Form using Node and Express for now. It serves static HTML pages. No front-end features just plain HTML with forms with simple login backend logic. 
2nd Item is my web-blog-app that uses Node and Express for Server side which will be serving static HTML pages with a simple design and backend logic. (Currently in progress)
